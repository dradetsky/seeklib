seeklib
=======

C++ library to go with ruby bindings to allow use of imgseek
fingerprint algorithm outside of imgseek.

Based on code by some dude named Ricardo Niederberger Cabral
(https://about.me/rncabral). His repo which I extracted the code from
is here: https://github.com/ricardocabral/iskdaemon.

I wanted to package this as a gem, as an alternative to
pHash/pHashion, but I don't know how to package a C++ library and ffi
bindings together (as opposed to C/C++ extensions), and couldn't find
instructions for doing it. If you know, please tell me or just fork it
and package it yourself.
